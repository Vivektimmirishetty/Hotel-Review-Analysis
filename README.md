# Hotel Review Analysis

Hotel Review Analysis and Sentiment Prediction
Welcome to the Hotel Review Analysis and Sentiment Prediction project! This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing hotel review data and predicting sentiments using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Project Overview
In this project, we aim to extract meaningful insights from hotel review texts and predict sentiments or other relevant labels. We employ two distinct classification approaches: EM-NB and SVM classifiers. The project's workflow includes meticulous data preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, classifier training and evaluation, and model selection based on comprehensive performance metrics.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing
Special Character Removal: Cleans the text data by removing unnecessary characters.
Tokenization: Splits the text into individual tokens.
Lowercase Conversion: Ensures uniformity by converting all text to lowercase.
Stop Word Elimination: Removes common, uninformative words.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base or root form.
2. Feature Extraction
NLP Techniques: Extracts meaningful features such as sentiment from textual reviews.
TF-IDF Transformation: Converts the preprocessed text into numerical vectors, creating feature-rich sparse matrices for classifier input.
3. Classification Approaches
EM-NB Classifier: Integrates Expectation-Maximization with Naive Bayes to handle missing data. Trained and evaluated using TF-IDF vectors.
SVM Classifier: Uses Support Vector Machines for text classification, with hyperparameters tuned for optimal performance.
4. Performance Evaluation
Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and cross-validation for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
5. Model Selection and Deployment
Informed Model Selection: Chooses the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Real-World Application: Offers valuable insights and predictions for enhancing decision-making and customer experiences in the hotel industry.
